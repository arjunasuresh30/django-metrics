This is a very basic web analytics project in DJango
** Capture events like Google Analytics and view them real time in 
   the django admin. Use a Javascript code and see results in real time 
   like mixpanel.

** Capture mouse motion like Click Tale but it closely coupled with python
   code as of now.
